<p><br /></p>

<p>The US-Mexico Borderlands Exhibit is the resulf of Phase 1 of United Fronteras. The exhibit consists of a digital directory of projects documenting contacts and divergences in the Mexico and the United States border region from pre-colonial times to the 21st century. This digital record allows you to see this border from different perspectives, including literature, archives, art, oral histories, music, etc., and compiles active and inactive platforms that make use of digital and/or technological components.</p>

<h2 id-"The first binational symposium of United Fronteras"><a href="https://tinyurl.com/unitedfronteras/">The first binational symposium of United Fronteras</a></h2> 

<p>Since 2019, the team of UnitedFronteras (phase 1) has compiled a series of projects/materials that use various kinds of digital technologies to shed light on different stories of the U.S.-Mexico border since pre-colonial times to the present. With a focus on Digital Humanities, the symposium aims to amplify all the outstanding work done about the Mexico-U.S. border before and after its geopolitical division utilizing digital technologies with a humanities lens. The event is an initial conversation with project creators and people committed to social justice in this region to understand the current state of field and proposed necessary and urgent collaborations, infrastructures, and specifications to expand platforms for border people to tell their own stories and intervene in the colonial structure of the analog and digital cultural record.</p>

        <p>United Fronteras brings together active, inactive and works in progress to document the borderlands from multiple perspectives (literature, archives, art, oral histories, music, among others) from pre-colonial times to the twenty-first century. The projects will be featured through several digital forms and registers, from exhibits to maps. Our goal is to offer audiences a unique opportunity to meaningfully engage in the multidimensional layers of border regions.</p>
