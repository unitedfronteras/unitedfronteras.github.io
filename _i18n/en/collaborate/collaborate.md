Please help us grow our database by including projects that work with material related to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands from pre-colonial times to the present.

Our consideration of projects relies on our Vision, which encompasses projects that focus on the
designated time periods, from pre-colonial times to the present. The formats in consideration are:
digital documentation, activism, mapping, blogs, podcast/video channel, etc.

Projects need to have a digital component, either presently active or inactive.

- Active Projects: include the title and a link to the project.
- Inactive: include the title and any information that can help us trace the project.
