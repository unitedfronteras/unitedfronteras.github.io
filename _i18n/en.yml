  description: United Fronteras brings together active, inactive and works in progress to document the borderlands from multiple perspectives (literature, archives, art, oral histories, music, among others) from pre-colonial times to the twenty-first century. The projects will be featured through several digital forms and registers, from exhibits to maps. Our goal is to offer audiences a unique opportunity to meaningfully engage in the multidimensional layers of border regions.
