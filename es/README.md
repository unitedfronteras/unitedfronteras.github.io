United Fronteras brings together active and inactive works that leverage digital components to document the borderlands from multiple perspectives (literature, archives, art, oral histories, music, among others) from the pre-colonial times to the twenty-first century. This platform establishes and maintains a digital record of projects that encompass the borderlands.The selected projects will be featured through a digital map and various visualizations that offer audiences a unique opportunity to meaningfully engage in the multi-dimensional layers of border spaces through multi-disciplinary, institutional, community-based, and individual collaborations.
